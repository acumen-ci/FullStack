# AcuCafe Full Stack Developer Assessment

AcuCafe has an ordering system which is poorly designed and sometimes fails to deliver the 
right orders. For example, some of the clients complain that their ice tea had milk in it. The
system has also turned out to be a maintenance nightmare as it is difficult to add new 
drinks. 

AcuCafe has selected you to update their ordering system to be able to: 
- Stop the preparation of an ice tea with milk and inform the barista
- Fix the order summary so it displays the drink and cost

As well as these functional requirements, they would like you to spend some time on the 
following:

Improve and refactor the codebase, considering the following
- Scalability as AcuCafe expands their drink and topping ranges
- Validation
- General maintainability of the codebase

Improve the UI
- The current UI doesn’t quite match the designs in Figma: [here](https://www.figma.com/file/9N9zM1e6XkBhxGtfAPCB2t/Full-Stack-AcuCafe?node-id=0%3A1)
- You may also spot other changes you could make to improve the user 
experience

You are unlikely to be able to make all the changes in the time given, so we’d like you to 
prioritise the aspects you think are the most important.

## System Requirements

The project consists of an ASP.NET Core API, and an Angular 10 front-end. You’ll need the 
following on your computer to run this:

- Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code
- .NET Core 3.1 SDK
- Node 14

Running the project from Visual Studio will also start the angular and open up a browser 
window.

## Inspecting Designs

It should be fairly easy to inspect the designs in Figma. Just ensure you create a free account 
at figma.com so that you can click around and inspect things like colours and fonts.

If you’re unfamiliar with where to find these things in Figma, take a look at this article: [An Overview of Figma for Developers](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/tips-on-developer-handoff/an-overview-of-figma-for-developers/)
